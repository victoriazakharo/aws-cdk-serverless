This example uses AWS CDK to build blog service same as in AWS Serverless template project for .NET: https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-dotnet/tree/master/Blueprints/BlueprintDefinitions/Msbuild-NETCore_2_1/DynamoDBBlogAPI

## Build

To build this app, you need to be in this example's root folder. Then run the following:

```bash
npm install -g aws-cdk
dotnet build src
```

This will install the necessary CDK, then this example's dependencies, and then build your csharp files and your CloudFormation template.

## Deploy

Run `cdk deploy`. This will deploy / redeploy your Stack to your AWS Account.

After the deployment you will see the API's URL, which represents the url you can then use to add and list blogs.

## Synthesize Cloudformation Template

To see the Cloudformation template generated by the CDK, run `cdk synth`, then check the output file in the "cdk.out" directory.
